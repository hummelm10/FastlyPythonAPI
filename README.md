# FastlyPythonAPI

## Description
Can access and perform certain tasks in the Fastly CDN/WAF using the API. 

## Setup
Rename Config-README.xml to Config.xml and make sure it is in the same folder as main.py or main.exe

### Bugs   
This is an open source tool cobled together via me learning Python on the fly. If you get stuck in some weird loop I recommend closing the terminal and trying again. This is not actively supported or maintained.
