# FastlyPythonAPI

## Description
Can access and perform basic tasks in the Fastly CDN/WAF using the API. 

## Setup

#### Install Requirements if using Source Code
Install python requirements (python 3.7+)

```pip3 install -r reqirements.txt```


#### Rename Config file

Rename ```Config-README.xml``` to ```Config.xml``` and make sure it is in the same folder as ```main.py``` or ```main.exe```

### Bugs   
This is an open source tool cobled together via me learning Python on the fly. If you get stuck in some weird loop I recommend closing the terminal and trying again.
